# Config Hell

We do not always need a new file for specifying configurations in our JS/TS projects. This has created bloated directories and file lists that are not necessary / are avoidable.

This repotory serves as a way to standardize an approach to solve this problem with hopes that library maintainers stick with this approach.

Can we all embrace `package.json` rather than creating our own new `.my-shiny-library.json`, `.my-very-good-libaray-rc`?
